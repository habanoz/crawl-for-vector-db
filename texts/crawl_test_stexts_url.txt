To its east lies Jordan.The West Bank has been occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war, but decades of difficult on-off talks between Israel and the Palestinians - both of whom assert rights there - have left its final status unresolved.Between 2.1 million and 3 million (sources vary) Palestinian Arabs live in the West Bank under both limited self-rule and Israeli military rule.The West Bank (excluding East Jerusalem) is also home to some 430,000 Israeli Jews who live in 132 settlements (and 124 smaller "outposts") built under Israel's occupation.
https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-middle-east-66085089 - The Israeli security services have just released pictures of what they say are improvised explosive devices (IEDs) hidden on roads and in buildings in Jenin refugee camp.Eleven devices have been neutralised by military engineers "acting on precise intelligence" to clear the roads, the statement says. They say barriers have also been "set up to hinder the activities of the forces in the camp", and they too have been removed.

https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-middle-east-66085089 - UN aid agencies this morning voiced alarm at the scale of Israel’s military operation in Jenin. A spokesman for the World Health Organization (WHO) said emergency health teams had been blocked from entering Jenin to treat the injured, adding that the WHO had reports that at least two hospitals had "experienced attacks". A spokeswoman for the UN’s emergency relief co-ordination (OCHA) called for immediate access for health workers, warning that hundreds of people had been injured, and three children were among the dead. Earlier today the medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) condemned what it said was "denial of medical access", saying: "Military bulldozers destroyed multiple roads leading to the Jenin refugee camp, stripping them of pavement and making it nearly impossible for ambulances to reach patients; during the raid, Palestinian paramedics have been forced to proceed on foot, in an area with active gunfire and drone strikes."All roads leading to the camp have been blocked for the duration of the military operation despite the presence of patients in need of care inside the refugee camp." MSF staff are working in Khalil Suleiman hospital, where they report several patients with gunshot wounds to the head.

https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-middle-east-66085089 - The Palestinian Authority (PA), which has some administrative and security responsibilities in areas of the occupied territories, has effectively lost control of Jenin refugee camp.One Israeli spokesperson has said this operation will allow the PA to regain authority.But the thing about the PA, which is a remnant of the peace process of the 1990s, is that among many Palestinians, they're absolutely discredited.It's a very ageing leadership, headed by 87-year-old President Mahmoud Abbas, and they haven't had elections for years. They also have not delivered independence, which was meant to be the point of its existence.But at the moment, the PA can't do anything to protect Palestinians from the activities of either the Israeli security forces, or more particularly from Jewish settlers in state-sponsored settlements in the occupied territories - who are there in breach of international law.These settlers in recent times have engaged in very serious pogroms, as the Israelis call them, after Palestinian attacks that have killed Jews.Such attacks on Palestinian villages and towns have led to a loss of life, significant damage to property and a sense of general fear among civilians.

https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230703-why-our-voices-change-with-age - In extreme cases of Reinke's oedema, surgery is needed to drain the fluid. But in most cases, rest and avoiding irritants (smoking and alcohol) is beneficial, while speech and language therapy can also address the change in sound. - While we can't help some of the age-related changes that happen to our vocal cords, we can maintain some of our vocal quality and ability through continued use. This may explain why, in many cases, singers show significantly less vocal change with age than their non-singing counterparts. - Singing or reading out loud daily can give the vocal cords sufficient exercise to slow their decline. - Looking after your vocal cords is also important. Staying hydrated and limiting intake of alcohol and tobacco can help prevent high rates of decline and damage. - * Adam Taylor is a professor and director of the Clinical Anatomy Learning Centre, Lancaster University - This article originally appeared on The Conversation, and is republished under a Creative Commons licence. - -- - Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram. - If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called "The Essential List" – a handpicked selection of stories from BBC Future, Culture, Worklife, Travel and Reel delivered to your inbox every Friday.
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230703-why-our-voices-change-with-age - There are also approximately 17 other muscles in the larynx that can alter vocal cord position and tension – thus changing the sound produced. - Pre-puberty, there's very little difference in the sound the vocal cords produce between females and males. But during puberty, hormones begin exerting their effects. This changes the structure of the larynx – making the "Adam's apple" more prominent in men – and the length of the vocal cords. After puberty, they're around 16mm (0.63in) in length in men, and 10mm (0.39in) in women. - Women's vocal cords are also 20-30% thinner after puberty. These shorter, thinner vocal cords are the reason why women typically have higher voices than men. - Even after puberty, hormones can affect the voice. For instance, a woman's voice may sound different depending on the stage of her menstrual cycle – with the best voice quality being in the ovulatory phase. This is because the glands produce most mucous during this phase, giving the vocal cords their best functional ability. - Research also shows that women taking the contraceptive pill show less variation in voice quality because the pill halts ovulation.

https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230703-why-our-voices-change-with-age - By Adam Taylor4th July 2023
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230703-why-our-voices-change-with-age - As we get older, the larynx begins increasing its mineral content, making it stiffer and more like bone than cartilage:
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230703-why-our-voices-change-with-age - Sir Elton John set a record at this year's Glastonbury, becoming the most-watched headliner in the festival's history, with more than seven million people tuning in live to the BBC to watch his last ever UK performance. - The 76-year-old singer certainly delivered all his characteristic showmanship. But many who have followed his music over the decades will have noticed how much his voice has changed during his career – and not only in the immediate aftermath of the surgery he had in the 1980s to remove polyps from his vocal cords. - The vocal cords are what produce the sound of your voice. They are located in the larynx, a part of the respiratory system that allows air to pass from your throat to your lungs. When air passes out of the lungs and through the larynx, it causes the vocal cords to vibrate – producing sound. - The vocal cords are composed of three main parts: the vocalis muscle, vocal ligament, and a mucous membrane (containing glands) to cover them. This keeps the surface moist and protects them from damage.
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230703-why-our-voices-change-with-age - Our voices are not immune to the effects of ageing. But there are some things that can help to keep them in good condition.
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230703-why-our-voices-change-with-age - On the other hand, hormonal changes during the premenstrual phase impede the vocal cords, making them stiffer. This may explain why opera singers would be offered "grace days" in the 1960s to ensure they didn't damage their vocal cords. And, because women's vocal cords are thinner, they may also be more likely to suffer damage from overuse. - As with almost every other part of the body, vocal cords age. But these changes might not be as noticeable for everyone. - As we get older, the larynx begins increasing its mineral content, making it stiffer and more like bone than cartilage. This change can begin happening as early as your thirties – especially in men. This makes the vocal cords less flexible. - The muscles that allow the vocal cords to move also begin wasting (as do our other muscles) as we age. The ligaments and tissues that support the vocal cords also lose elasticity, becoming less flexible.
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230703-why-our-voices-change-with-age - There's also a decrease in pulmonary muscle function, reducing the power of the air expelled from the lungs to create the sound. The number of glands that produce the protective mucus also decrease, alongside a reduction in the ability to control the larynx. - While vocal cords age at largely the same rate in most people, many lifestyle factors can increase the risk of damage to them – and so can change the way your voice sounds. - Smoking, for example, causes localised inflammation, increased mucous production, but can also dry out the mucosal surfaces. Alcohol has a similar effect. Over time, these factors can damage the vocal cords and alter the voice's sound. - You might also like: - Should you sing when you have a cold? - The ingredients for a long life - Why we get nicer as we get older - Some over-the-counter and prescription drugs can also alter the voice – such as steroid inhalers used for laryngitis. Blood thinners may also damage the vocal cords and can cause polyps to form, making the voice sound raspy or hoarse. Muscle relaxants, too, can lead to irritation and vocal cord damage due to the drug allowing stomach acid to wash back into the larynx. The irritation and changes caused by these medications typically disappears after stopping use. - One other lifestyle factor can be overuse, which is typically seen in singers and other people who use their voice a lot during work, such as teachers and fitness instructors. This can lead to an uncommon condition called Reinke's oedema, which can also be caused by smoking. Reinke's oedema causes fluid to swell in the vocal cords, changing the pitch of the voice – often making it deeper.

https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230702-11-of-the-best-tv-shows-to-watch-this-july - 9. Dark Winds - One of television's best under-the-radar series returns for a second season, with Zahn McClarnon (Reservation Dogs and Fargo) as Lt. Joe Leaphorn of the Navajo Police. Based on Tony Hillerman's crime novels set in the US South West during the 1970s, the first season revealed that Joe's son had been killed in a suspicious oil drilling explosion. The new series has him tracking the man he suspects of causing the tragedy. Joining him is Sgt Bernadette Manuelito (Jessica Matten) and his former partner Jim Chee (Kiowa Gordon), now a private detective. McClarnon makes Leaphorn an iconic figure, a Native American update on the Western hero, tough, wise and not necessarily beyond taking revenge. Dark Winds' executive producers include Robert Redford and George RR Martin, but it stands on its own as taut, atmospheric and deeply humane, with the texture of life on the reservation and the vast desert landscape vital parts of the show. - Dark Winds premieres 27 July on AMC+ and 30 July on AMC

https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230702-11-of-the-best-tv-shows-to-watch-this-july - 4. Survival of The Thickest - The very funny comic actress and stand-up Michelle Buteau is familiar as the what's-her-name best friend in films including Always Be My Maybe and Marry Me with Jennifer Lopez, and as part of the ensemble on BET's First Wives Club. She gets the starring role here in a series she has created, loosely based on her book of comic essays, also called Survival Of The Thickest. Her fictional character, Mavis Beaumont, leaves her cheating partner when she finds him with another woman. Single at age 38, she tries to restart her romantic life and jumpstart her career. She may not make the best choices, however, as is evident in the fact that she is a fashion-challenged stylist. - Survival of The Thickest premieres on 13 July on Netflix
https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230702-11-of-the-best-tv-shows-to-watch-this-july - 7. Special Ops: Lioness - Far from the ranches of Yellowstone and 1923, prolific showrunner Taylor Sheridan takes on the CIA in his latest series, set in the world of counterterrorism. The title refers to his fictionalised version of a CIA programme. Zoe Saldana stars as Joe, the head of a team (like Carrie in Homeland). She sends an agent, Cruz Manuelos (Laysla De Oliveira) undercover to get close to the daughter of a suspected terrorist, so the CIA can, as Joe says in the trailer, "kill the target". Nicole Kidman has a supporting role as a CIA supervisor, and Morgan Freeman is the US Secretary of State. Intrigue and suspense should drive the plots, but Sheridan-watchers will be looking for the subtext too. Sheridan has always said his shows have no political slant, while many commentators see a conservative streak. It will be fascinating to see what the series might say about US policy and terrorism. - Special Ops: Lioness premieres 23 July on Paramount+

https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230702-11-of-the-best-tv-shows-to-watch-this-july - 1. The Horror of Dolores Roach - Is Dolores horrified or is she the horror? Maybe both in this dramedy, the latest to jump on the trend of podcasts turned into television series. Justina Machado (One Day at a Time) is the title character, recently released after a 16-year-prison stint, who returns to her now-gentrifying New York City neighbourhood. Her shady old friend gives her a place to stay and a massage table, but if you've ever heard a murder podcast you'll know that her new life won't go smoothly and her nickname of Magic Hands will only get her so far. If the title weren't clue enough, the series is produced by the horror masters at Blumhouse, and is being described as "Sweeney Todd-inspired". Yum? - The Horror of Dolores Roach premieres on 7 July on Prime Video
https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230702-11-of-the-best-tv-shows-to-watch-this-july - 11. Good Omens - This odd-couple comic fantasy, based on the novel by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, continues for another season, with Michael Sheen as the fussy angel Aziraphale and David Tennant as the brash, anything-goes demon Crowley. Last time they saved the world from the Antichrist. This time their comfy London life is interrupted when they team up to get the angel Gabriel out of trouble after he vanishes from heaven and pops up at Aziraphale's bookshop. Jon Hamm returns as the often befuddled Gabriel, who Gaiman has called "everyone's worst boss". For all its religious and spiritual allusions, Good Omens is the most light-hearted of all the Gaiman adaptations (Netflix's The Sandman and Amazon Prime's American Gods among them), which makes it the most fun. - Good Omens premieres July 28 on Prime Video - Love film and TV?

Praise Petey - After so many serious exposés of cults, the time seems right for an animated comedy on the subject. Anna Drezen, a former head writer on Saturday Night Live, has created this series, which puts an absurdist spin on the old fish-out-of-water and woman-starting-over stories. Petey, voiced by Schitt's Creek star Annie Murphy, is a cosmopolitan New Yorker who takes over her father's small-town cult after her city life falls apart. John Cho is the voice of cult member and possible romantic interest Bandit, who was raised in the organisation. Stephen Root, so chilling and ruthless as hitman handler Monroe Fuches in the later seasons of Barry, is Petey's father, and Christine Baranski is her sophisticated, non-cult-following mother. - Praise Petey premieres 21 July on Freeform

https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230702-11-of-the-best-tv-shows-to-watch-this-july - 5. Justified: City Primeval - Proving the theory that nothing on television has to stay dead forever, the beloved 2010-15 crime series Justified, based on Elmore Leonard's stories about US Deputy Marshal Raylan Givens, has been rebooted with new locations. Timothy Olyphant (pictured) is the constant as Givens, who has the same swagger and same Western hat as in the original series. Now Givens has moved from Kentucky to Florida, and is taking his feisty 15-year-old daughter (Olyphant's real daughter, Vivian Olyphant) to camp when some thugs get in their way. Raylan and daughter end up in Detroit, where he has to track down a killer known as the Oklahoma Wildman. Inspired by Leonard's 1980 novel City Primeval: High Noon in Detroit, the new location adds urban grit to Givens; Western dynamic, a smart way to reinvigorate a familiar show. - Justified: City Primeval premieres 18 July on FX and 19 July on Hulu
https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230702-11-of-the-best-tv-shows-to-watch-this-july - 2. The Afterparty - Season 2 of the slyly comic whodunnit series brings back Tiffany Haddish and Sam Richardson as detectives who can't seem to agree on anything, with a new cast of murder suspects and a new crime. The format, a delight for movie lovers, is the same: each episode is told from a different character's point of view, in a different cinematic style, this time ranging from noir to 19th-Century costume drama, and apparently including a take on Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums. When a bridegroom is killed – worst wedding ever – everyone at the ceremony is a suspect, including the bride, her family and their friends, played by John Cho, Paul Walter Hauser, Ken Jeong, Elizabeth Perkins and Zach Woods. - The Afterparty premieres on 12 July on AppleTV+
https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230702-11-of-the-best-tv-shows-to-watch-this-july - 10. Twisted Metal - Following recent HBO hit The Last of Us, here comes another video-game adaptation set in a post-apocalyptic world. Anthony Mackie, best known as Falcon (and soon to be Captain America) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is at the centre of this action comedy inspired by the PlayStation title, a demolition derby with lethal weapons. Mackie plays John Doe, who has amnesia, and agrees to deliver a mysterious package. He loads his gun, gets in his beat-up car and races off across the US. Stephanie Beatriz plays a car thief named Quiet, Thomas Haden Church is the villainous highway patrolman Agent Stone, while Sweet Tooth, a demented killer clown, is played physically by the wrestler Joe Seanoa (Samoa Joe) with Will Arnett's voice. The game has been around since 1995, with various further instalments appearing over the years, so the series has a built-in fan base. - Twisted Metal premieres 27 July on Peacock

https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230702-11-of-the-best-tv-shows-to-watch-this-july - 3. Full Circle - Steven Soderbergh never takes a breath. He has tended to direct at least one film or streaming series a year recently, from 2019's underrated High Flying Bird to this year's best forgotten Magic Mike's Last Dance. Some of his strongest work has been in television drama, notably The Knick, and his latest is a crime series full of promise, suspense and first-rate actors, including Claire Danes, Timothy Olyphant, Zazie Beetz and Jharrel Jerome. Danes and Olyphant play a couple who receive a call that their son has been kidnapped, and Beetz investigates, turning up family secrets involving crime, cash and the country of Guyana. - Full Circle premieres on 13 July on Max

https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230702-11-of-the-best-tv-shows-to-watch-this-july - 8. Futurama - After 10 years away, the long-running animated sci-fi satire returns with new stories and the same off-the-wall characters. In the original, Fry (Billy West) was cryogenically frozen in 1999, only to thaw out in the year 3000, where he met the love of his life, Cyclops Leela (Katy Sagal), and the robot Bender (John DiMaggio), among other eccentrics. The new episodes pick up 23 years later, with an updated spin on social trends. A newsreader reports on a recently discovered virus, Explovid-23, which can be tested for with a gigantic cotton swab up your nose. A banner at an outdoor event says "Back-to-Normal Fest 2021", with 2021 crossed out and 3023 hand-written in. The series was created by Matt Groening of Simpsons fame – and a family resemblance can be seen in the character's wide-jawed faces, and humour that is both skewering and silly. - Futurama premieres 24 July on Hulu

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65889461 - Steven Gerrard won the Scottish Premiership with Rangers in 2020-21Former England and Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard has been named manager of Saudi Arabian side Al-Ettifaq."Without a doubt, Gerrard's presence will be an addition and a quantum leap to our league," said Khalid Al-Dabal, the club's chairman.Gerrard has signed a two-year contract with the Saudi club.Al-Ettifaq were seventh in the 16-team Saudi Pro League last season, finishing 35 points behind champions Al-Ittihad.Gerrard has been out of work since being sacked as Aston Villa manager in October last year.The former England midfielder's move to Saudi Arabia follows a summer of heavy investment by Pro League clubs as several top European players have joined Manchester United striker Cristiano Ronaldo in the Middle East.Why is Saudi Pro League signing Premier League stars?Football Daily podcast: Roy returns (again) as Gerrard signs in SaudiFormer Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema, Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves and Chelsea trio N'Golo Kante, Kalidou Koulibaly and Edouard Mendy are among those to move to Saudi Arabia, with Inter Milan's Marcelo Brozovic to Al-Nassr the most recent deal to be completed.Fulham managed Marco Silva has also reportedly turned down a £17m offerexternal-link to coach Al-Hilal. The trend underlines the league's ambition to be one of the top five in the world and follows a decision in June by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), which owns Newcastle United, to take over four leading clubs in the country. Al-Ettifaq is not one of those clubs.Gerrard retired from playing in 2016 and his first managerial role was at Scottish club Rangers.He took over the Ibrox side in 2018 and led the club to their first Scottish Premiership title in 10 years in 2020-21.Gerrard then became Villa boss in November 2021 but left after 13 wins from 40 games during his time in charge.

He also played pretty well for England in the Qatar world cup which isn't that far away.I could see him getting Al-Ettifaq into a Champions League space within a couple of seasons.
