The UN's Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, says it is "deeply concerned" about the impact of the Israeli operation in Jenin refugee camp.In a statement, it says water and electricity services have been interrupted in large areas of the camp, leaving residents "unable to move from their homes"."Many are in urgent need of food, drinking water and milk powder for children," Unrwa says.Unrwa says its 10 installations in the camp - including four schools and one health centre - had been left unable
and one health centre - had been left unable to operate due to "heavy exchange of fire", and "urgent action is required to ensure those injured have access to medical care".The UN agency calls on "all parties" to "break this cycle of increasing violence", the statement adds.

At the Palestinian hospital by the main entrance to the Jenin refugee camp, the mood is grim.It is close to the intense gun battles that are still taking place but a few residents have been able to visit their injured relatives.One man told the BBC there was "a massacre" in the camp.He said there were children and civilians in the camp but "they’re not letting them out"."Our electricity is cut, they have dug up all our roads. The camp will be destroyed," he added.
There are many civilians still in the refugee camp - it's such a densely populated area. You'll sometimes have whole generations of a family in one small flat, even in one room.It raises the question of how Israeli forces are managing to carry out the pinpoint operation they talked about at a briefing on Monday evening.They said they were using intelligence and particular weaponry to exclude the civilian population from what they were doing - but an operation of this size in what is an area home
an operation of this size in what is an area home to thousands of families is not without risk.Only when the operation is over will we have an idea of the impact it's had on them.

This is not the first drone attack to target Moscow. In May, Russia's defence ministry said at least eight drones caused minor damage.
Another was reportedly shot down near the village of Valuevo, also near the airport.
It was the first time the city had been targeted by multiple drones since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and came after Moscow blamed Kyiv for a drone attack on the Kremlin.
